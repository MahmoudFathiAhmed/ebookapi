      "description": "Work in the coal mines, social hour at the barber shop, and making moonshine in the Tennessee hills isn't fun if you can't laugh about it! Here is a hilarious anthology of jokes and anecdotes about life in the mountains and much much more! I have been a barber for 45 years, everyone knows that a lot of hair gets on the floor and everyone talks about what to do with it. I hear you can put it around the house to keep the deer out, so I tried something new I put the hair around the tomatoes. I had some beautiful tomatoes but I had to shave them before I could eat them. One of my uncles was the biggest whiskey man in Tennessee he made moonshine whiskey for 45 years. I will tell you how good his whiskey was, a man moved up on the mountain, he had a wooden leg he started drinking the new whiskey called Block and Tackle. A few months later he noticed sprouts were growing on his leg, he had to carry a axe to keep the sprouts cut off.",

      "author": "Rod A. Martin",
      "category": "humor",
      "description": "Research on humor is carried out in a number of areas in psychology, including the cognitive (What makes something funny?), developmental (when do we develop a sense of humor?), and social (how is humor used in social interactions?) Although there is enough interest in the area to have spawned several societies, the literature is dispersed in a number of primary journals, with little in the way of integration of the material into a book. Dr. Martin is one of the best known researchers in the area, and his research goes across subdisciplines in psychology to be of wide appeal. This is a singly authored monograph that provides in one source, a summary of information researchers might wish to know about research into the psychology of humor. The material is scholarly, but the presentation of the material is suitable for people unfamiliar with the subject-making The Psychology of Humor suitable for use for advanced undergraduate and graduate level courses on the psychology of humor-which have not had a textbook source. 2007 AATH Book Award for Humor/Laughter Research category! Up-to-date coverage of research on humor and laughter in every area of psychology Research findings are integrated into a coherent conceptual framework Includes recent brain imaging studies, evolutionary models, and animal research Draws on contributions from sociology, linguistics, neuroscience, and anthropology Provides an overview of theories of humor and early research Explores applications of humor in psychotherapy, education, and the workplace Points out interesting topics for further research and promising research methodologies Written in a scholarly yet easily accessible style 2007 AATH Book Award for Humor/Laughter Research category",

      "author": "Jean E. Jost",
      "category": "humor",
      "description": "Originally published in 1994. Chaucer is considered the first major humorist in English literature and is particularly interesting as he reflects the humor of predecessors and contemporaries as well as defines development for subsequent British humor. This collection presents essays that define the nature of Chaucerian humor, examine Chaucer’s works from a variety of theoretical perspectives, and consider genres of humor within his writing. This is an excellent work of critical discourse that adds important understanding of Chaucer as well as the field of comedy in literature.",
